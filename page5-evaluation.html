      <h2>Reflection Overview</h2>
      <p>Throughout this year is Digital Tech, I have gotten better at Html & Css, learnt how to wire and code Arduinos/NeoPixel rings, as well as use Blender to create and render whatever I like (a Dunegon in particular). I think I have suceeded in every single project this year, and have learnt alot.</p>

        For Project 4, I had styled both of my pages I needed to add. However, I had forgotten what I wanted to put on these pages/what they should look like. I decided I would try use a lot more ai in this assesment as my peers had in past assesments and they said I was super helpful. When I tried to use it though, I found it was hard for it to understand exactly what I wanted. I ended up doing most of the code for both my pages,but for my review page I decided to use fully ai for it. It turned out okay, however it was a bit bland/boring.

        In conclusion this year, I have realised I HATE C++, I love html & css, and I enjoy Blender.Working with these different technologies has helped me discover my strengths and preferences in digital tech. HTML and CSS allowed me to be creative while building functional designs, and Blender opened up a whole world of 3D modelling that I never thought I would enjoy. On the other hand, C++ taught me the challenges of programming logic, even if it wasn’t my favourite.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, this project has taught me not just technical skills, but also problem-solving, perseverance, and how to choose the right tool for the job. I now feel more confident in my ability to plan, create, and reflect on digital projects, and I can see how these skills will apply in future projects or even real-world scenarios.</p>
